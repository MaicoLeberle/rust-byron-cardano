# Rust implementation of Cardano primitives, helpers, and related applications

Cardano Rust is a modular toolbox of Cardanoâ€™s cryptographic primitives, a
library of wallet functions and a future alternative Cardano node
implementation written in Rust. It can be used by any third-party to build
wallet applications and interact with the Cardano blockchain.

## How to integrate the Rust library in your project

Information will be available soon on crates.io

In the mean time, it is possible to add the project using git submodules:

```git submodule add https://github.com/input-output-hk/rust-cardano cardano-deps```

And then by adding the following to your Cargo.toml:

```
[dependencies]
cardano = { path = "cardano-deps/cardano" }
```
